# ESP32 MeArm Controller

Welcome to the ESP32 MeArm Controller repository, developed by the K1-07 LTF II team as part of their final project in Physics Engineering Lab II at Bandung Institute of Technology. This repository contains the source code for the ESP32 microcontroller, designed to interface with the MeArm robotic arm through Wi-Fi communication. The ESP32 serves as the bridge between the MeArm robotic arm and the MeArm Controller Android app, facilitating three unique modes of operation: Canvas Mode, D-Pad Mode, and Joystick Mode.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Communication**: Leverage the ESP32's Wi-Fi capabilities to connect with the Android app.
- **Multi-Mode Operation**: Supports three control modes for the MeArm robotic arm.
  - **Canvas Mode**: Draw a path for the arm to follow.
  - **D-Pad Mode**: Use directional buttons for precise control.
  - **Joystick Mode**: Enjoy traditional joystick control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP32 Development Board
- MeArm Robotic Arm Kit
- Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF
- Basic knowledge of microcontroller programming

### Installation

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Make sure your development environment is set up with Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF.
2. **Clone the Repository**
3. **Open the Project**: Open the cloned project in your development environment.
4. **Configure Wi-Fi**: Update the Wi-Fi SSID and password in the code to match your network.
5. **Upload the Code**: Compile and upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Usage

After uploading the code to your ESP32, connect the MeArm robotic arm. Open the MeArm Controller app on your Android device, connect to the same Wi-Fi network as your ESP32, and select the control mode you prefer.
